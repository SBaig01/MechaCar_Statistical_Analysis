## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
The following 2 variables provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values (see details below)
1) vehicle_length: p-value = 2.60e-12 (see below)
2) ground_clearance: p-value = 5.21e-08 (see below)


### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The slope is NOT considered to be zero as the p-value is significant i.e. <0.05. This is grounds for rejecting the null-hypothesis indicating that the slope is not zero.

### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
The multiple r-squared value is 0.7149 (see details below)
